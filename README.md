# Autobiography Generator

This is a simple streamlit application that generates a 500-word draft of an autobiography based on user input. The app uses the OpenAI API and the immaga.com API to extract tags from user-uploaded photos and generate text based on the filtered tags and a user-defined prompt.

## Installation

To run the app, you will need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the app is running, you can upload a photo and modify the generated tags as needed. You can then enter a prompt and click the 'Generate' button to generate a 500-word draft of an autobiography. The generated text will be displayed on the screen in Korean and can be edited using the text editor. You can also download the finished autobiography text as a .docx file with photos.
